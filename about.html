                <p>Koh Tao Island is a tiny Island near Koh Samui Island.  These islands are just East of the southern penninsula of Thailand.  Koh Tao means "Island Turtle" in Thai so adding the word island after Koh Tao is a bit redundant.</p>
                <p>There are some notable islands off the coast of Koh Tao, namely shark island, a major dive site on the south east end of Koh Tao and Koh Nang Yuan to the Northwest.  Koh Nang Yuan has a great viewpoint where you can look down at the narrow strip of sand that connects the cluster of islands that make up Koh Nang Yuan.  It is very common for snorkel tours to stop here since the snorkeling around Koh Nang Yuan is super clear.  Also many of the tourists want to make the trek up to the top of the island for a snapshot of the viewpoint.</p>
                <p>The island of Koh Tao is very hilly.  There are roads that traverse the mountain in the middle of the island but they are a bit sketchy.  There is the main road that stretches from the northwest corner to the southern tip of the island and that road is mostly flat.  It's a fun island to explore on a rented motorbike.  One can also hire the pickup truck taxi's that are available on the island but they are very expensive.  You'll spend as much or more for one taxi ride as you will for the cost of a whole day of scooter riding.</p>
                <p>The island is very touristy.  There are plenty of restaurants of all kinds and costs along the main roads and bordering the beaches.  You'll easily play double the cost of a meal on this island as you will on the mainland of Thailand.  Speaking of touristy, there is another great viewpoint on the island itself.  It's called John Suwan Viewpoint and it's at the southern most tip of the island.  There is a small fee charged for access to the viewpoint and Freedom beach together for one price.</p>
                <p>Diving and Snorkeling are the main attractions of the island.  Much of the year at least one side of the island will have nice, smooth, clear water that is 82 degrees F All year round.  It's plenty warm enough to stay in the water for hours without being chilled  The best snorkeling is found in and around the huge boulders around the edges of the island so all snorkel spots can easily be reached by just walking into the water from the beach.  There are no major currents around the island, no rip tides whatsoever and no dangerous sharks (only little blacktipped reef sharks).</p>
